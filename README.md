# Agentic AI Generator

This project generates, manages, and deploys autonomous AI agents using Python and advanced agent frameworks. It uses OpenAI or Gemini models for generating content and ideas, and supports agent communication through gRPC.

## Features

- Automatically creates Python agents based on a customizable template  
- Each agent is assigned a distinct personality, domain, and creative focus  
- Agents can communicate and collaborate using gRPC runtime  
- Modular architecture using RoutedAgent and AssistantAgent classes

## Technology Stack

- Python as the core programming language  
- Autogen Core framework for building and routing agents  
- OpenAI or Gemini AI models for generating agent code and ideas  
- gRPC for distributed communication between agents  
- python-dotenv for managing API keys through environment variables

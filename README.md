Each agent is assigned a distinct personality, domain, and creative focus

Agents can communicate and collaborate using gRPC runtime

The architecture is modular and uses RoutedAgent and AssistantAgent classes

Tech Stack
Python - core language used
Autogen Core - framework for building agents
OpenAI or Gemini - for generating agent code and ideas
gRPC - for communication between distributed agents
python-dotenv - for managing API keys through environment variables
